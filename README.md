# Rocket Telemetry Platform :rocket:
A web-based application for monitoring and managing rocket flight data. This system allows users to create rocket projects, capture telemetry data in real-time, and visualize flight performance metrics. 

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Frontend**: HTML 🌐, CSS 🎨, JavaScript 💻
- **Backend**: Python 🐍, Flask 🌶️
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server 🗄️
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication 🔒
- **Data Processing**: Real-time data handling with Flask routes 🚀
## Features & Screenshoots
:red_square: **User Authentication System:**

The application implements a secure authentication system that manages user access and account security. Users can register new accounts, log in securely, and recover forgotten passwords through a verification process. The system supports different user roles (admin and regular users) to manage access levels appropriately.

:red_square:**Project Management Interface**

Users can create and manage multiple rocket projects through an intuitive interface. Each project captures essential details including the project name ,rocket name and payload name. The system allows users to organize their projects efficiently while maintaining a limit of 10 projects per user to ensure optimal performance.

:red_square:**Real-time Telemetry Dashboard(Main Page):**

The heart of the system lies in its telemetry interface, which provides real-time monitoring of rocket flight data. The dashboard displays crucial flight parameters including:
- Altitude tracking with precise measurements
- Speed and acceleration monitoring
- Temperature readings during flight
- Geographic positioning with latitude and longitude
- Mission time tracking
- Rocket identification and status
-Payload information
